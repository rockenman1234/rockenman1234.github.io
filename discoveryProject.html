    <h2>Part 1. Learning to Soldering</h2>
        <img src="./images/dp/start1.webp" alt="A rough first solder attempt" class="rotate270" height="500" width="600">
        <p>Georgia Tech offers an array of opportunities for Computer Engineering students to delve into practical electronics, 
          one such avenue being the utilization of the cutting-edge soldering stations housed within The Hive, 
          a collaborative workspace fostering innovation and hands-on learning. 
          For many, including myself, embarking on the journey of soldering was akin to entering uncharted territory. 
          However, armed with determination and the wealth of resources provided by the institute, 
          this venture became an enriching educational experience. Initially, 
          the prospect of wielding a soldering iron may seem daunting, 
          but with the aid of instructional YouTube videos recommended by our mentors and the guidance of seasoned peers leaders, 
          the process gradually demystified.
        </p>
        <p>Picutred above was the first solder blob I ever made, as you can see - it's very rough, and was eventually redone.
            But it provided a great learning experience for me to understand the basics of soldering and how to properly solder components together.
            It was also strong enough to run an initial test with a multi-meter to ensure that the connection was made and no solder pads were bridged.
        </p>
        <br> 
    <h2>Part 2. Starting Small</h2>

        <img src="./images/dp/AddingNobs3.webp" alt="Starting Small!" class="rotate270" height="500" width="600">
        <p>As a novice in the realm of soldering, I commenced my journey by undertaking a 
          modest yet foundational project: assembling a radio kit i picked up on amazon. This undertaking served 
          as an invaluable starting point, allowing me to acclimate myself to the intricacies 
          of soldering while yielding tangible results. With soldering iron in hand and 
          components laid out, I meticulously followed the instructions, 
          carefully maneuvering through each step under the watchful eye of experienced 
          technicians available in The Hive. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Challenges inevitably arose, from deciphering resistor bands to ensuring precise connections, 
          yet each hurdle conquered instilled within me a sense of accomplishment and fueled my determination to persevere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pictured above to the left is the first soldered component of the radio kit, a few resistors. Pictured to the right, 
          following the resistors, I decided to install the speaker and the volume/tune control knobs.
        </p>

    <h2>Part 3. Building out</h2>
        <img src="./images/dp/AddingAntena4.webp" alt="Starting to look promising!" class="rotate270" height="500" width="600"">
        <img src="./images/dp/AddingResistors5.webp" alt="More tiny bits" class="rotate270" height="500" width="600">
        <p>As my proficiency in soldering burgeoned, so too did the complexity of the project. 
          With a newfound confidence, I embarked on more ambitious endeavors, 
          honing my skills through the construction of increasingly intricate circuits. 
          The Hive provided not only the requisite tools but also a collaborative environment conducive 
          to experimentation and innovation. Here, I discovered the true essence of hands-on learning, 
          where theory seamlessly melded with practice, and mistakes served as invaluable learning opportunities.
          My journey helped me to develop a keen eye for detail, from troubleshooting circuitry to 
          mastering the art of desoldering, each challenge I encountered 
          propelled me further along my journey of technical proficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pictured above to the left is the addition of the antenna to the radio kit, 
          which was a bit tricky to solder on due to the large size anenta in relation to it's of the solder pads.
          Pictured to the right, I added a few more resistors to the board along with a FM decoder chip, 
          which was a bit more challenging than the first few resistors due to the added weight of the board.
        </p>

    <h2>Part 4. All Done!</h2>
        <img src="./images/dp/Done6.webp" alt="All Done!" class="rotate270" height="500" width="600">
        <p>After about three hours of meticulous soldering and troubleshooting, 
          my radio kit stood proudly assembled! A testament to my newfound soldering proficiency and the myriad 
          opportunities afforded by Georgia Tech. Beyond the mere completion of a project, this endeavor 
          instilled within me a profound appreciation for the intersection of theory and practice, 
          underscoring the importance of hands-on experience in the field of computer engineering. 
          As I began to first test the radio, the static crackling of the speaker served as a symphony of success to my ears!
          As I reflected upon my journey, from the initial trepidation of wielding a soldering iron to 
          the triumphant culmination of my efforts, I was reminded of the advancement of technology.
          The radio kit I assembled was a testament to the advancements in micro-electronics and the
          transformative power of exploration and the boundless potential inherent within each opportunity seized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pictured above is the final product of the radio kit, fully assembled and functional!
        </p>
